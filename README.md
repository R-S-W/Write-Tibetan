# Write Tibetan

A Tibetan Keyboard App made with Dart and Flutter. &nbsp;Available on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/write-tibetan/id1615471990) and [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.RaymondWu.com.tibetan_handwriting_app_0_1&hl=en&gl=US)

Tibetan is a complex language: it is both grammatically and phonetically, distinctive from English. &nbsp;The written language is even more challenging, originally inspired by sanskrit from India, modern day Tibetan retains its spelling and structure from its creation 1200 years ago.&nbsp; A tibetan character can be composed of multiple stacked letters and vowels, leading to hundreds of unique forms.&nbsp; This posed a considerable problem in creating a method to input Tibetan onto a computer.&nbsp; Various tibetan input methods have been created, some mapping english words to tibetan syllables, while others construct the character component by component with a custom keyboard.&nbsp; 

Despite these efforts, there still is a disconnect for Tibetans and students in using out the language.&nbsp; The most popular method, the english to tibetan mapping, only permits users like students to type in english to write in tibetan, abstracting them from the language.&nbsp; When writing the syllable "བསྐྱིས," they remember and type the unwieldy word "bskyis" as opposed to remembering its tibetan letters. &nbsp;Likewise, Tibetans fluent in their language must write it through a clunky set of words like "brgyud" and "brnyog."

Write Tibetan is an app that allows users to write Tibetan and learn basic Tibetan characters.&nbsp; Users write by drawing characters on the screen and are given a list of different characters from the suggestion bar.&nbsp; A textbox above displays the output text that can be copied and pasted into ones notes, messages, and other apps.&nbsp;

to create an app that allows users to practice handwriting in Tibetan.

I created a handwriting recognition software that predicts and suggests characters as the user writes.

The software accounts for the complex, stacked composite characters and vowels unique to written Tibetan.
